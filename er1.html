  <h1><strong>Ethical Reasoning #1: Machine Bias</strong>
  </h1>
  <p class="first">
    In the traditional American judicial system, judges determine whether a person should be convicted, their sentence, and the probability that they will commit another offense. However, in this new age of technology and machine generated algorithms, a new juridical system has been created. The use of algorithms to predict the likelihood that a future offense will be committed. Even though computers might create a perfect formula, they cannot effectively apply their sense of right and wrong. The article Machine Bias explains that these new algorithms predict the “likelihood” that an offender would commit another crime. These formulas however, seem to have a bias against blacks. According to a study done by ProPublic,”Black defenders were still 77% more likely to be pegged as at higher risk of committing a future violent crime and 45% more likely to be predicted to commit a future crime of any kind.”

These biases however, are not limited to race. According to the article A.I. Programs Exhibit Racial and Gender Biases, these prejudices applied to gender as well. The most basic associations that the computers have made are innocent. The article A.I. Programs Exhibit Racial and Gender Biases explains that their computers associate words like flowers with “pleasantness”. The machines are not to be given all of the blame, though. The algorithms that were created are taking information from the past to predict the future. Humans have been (and still are) biased. Causing the algorithms to pick up the biases. As stated earlier, these computers have no way of filtering out these inherited prejudices.

In summation, America has been built on racism and sexism. These preconceptions are taught and handed down from generation to generation. As the eras change and a new A.I. generation emerges, the partisanships are being passed down once more. The problem will turn for the worst as the dependence for computers and machines greaten. If a solution isn’t found, then these prejudices will continue to run in American blood.
